# Detection-and-classification-of-Polish-traffic-signs

# Project Overview

Two-phase approach was adopted in this project, leveraging distinct machine learning models tailored to the nature of the data available. In the initial phase, the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB) dataset was incorporated, featuring a diverse array of traffic sign images under various conditions. YOLOv8, an advanced neural network architecture renowned for real-time object detection, was employed for the detection task. This model facilitated rapid and accurate identification of traffic signs within complex images, proving pivotal for this phase's success.

Subsequently, the focus shifted to classifying the identified traffic signs using the VGGNet neural network model. VGGNet's deep architecture excels in extracting features from images, thereby ensuring precise classification. The model was trained on traffic sign images from the Polish dataset.

Python served as the primary programming language for the project, with TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries utilized for constructing and training the neural networks. Visualization of outcomes was accomplished using Matplotlib and Seaborn, ensuring clear and aesthetically pleasing presentation of results.
